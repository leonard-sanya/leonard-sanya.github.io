        <h2>About Me</h2>
### **Refined Problem Statement**  
Fish drying is essential for food security and income generation in East Africa, but traditional methods suffer from:  
1. **Energy inefficiency** – Reliance on firewood (leading to deforestation) or fossil fuels (high cost, emissions).  
2. **Inconsistent product quality** – Poor drying control results in microbial contamination, nutrient loss, or unattractive products.  
3. **Economic unsustainability** – High operational costs and low market competitiveness reduce profitability for small-scale fishers.  
While modern drying technologies (e.g., solar dryers, heat pumps) exist, their adoption is limited due to:  
- Lack of **data-driven decision-making** for East Africa’s climate, resource availability, and socio-economic constraints.  
- No systematic approach to **balance trade-offs** between energy use, drying efficiency, cost, and environmental impact.  
Your research fills this gap by developing an **optimization-ML framework** to recommend the best drying techniques for sustainability.
